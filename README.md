## Daemon Support
I've created a daemon that lives in userspace which allows one to easily interact with the driver. It abstracts away some of the logic and also (will eventually) allow you to build
custom effects, though it does do mulitcoloured ripples :). As every device is slightly different I've maintained a mapping between devices supported by the driver and devices supported
by the daemon. If your device is supported by the driver but not by the daemon then raise an issue.

##Contributions

Some guys have already donated to the cause. ;-) Feel free.
The parent of the fork had a list of what would be done if money was donated. I don't need the money (though you can never have enough right ;-) ), but obviously its a great motivator.
If you want you device and your not willing to get one to me then if your willing to follow [this](https://github.com/pez2001/razer_chroma_drivers/wiki/Reverse-Engineering-USB-Protocol) then support can be added.
