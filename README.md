## Applications

The following applications compliment and interact with this driver:

* [Polychromatic Controller](https://github.com/lah7/polychromatic-controller) - a graphical management tool and tray applet to managing Razer peripherals.
* [MacroW](https://github.com/igorbb/MacroW) - a simple tool to record and play keyboard macros.


## Command Line Usage


 Have a look at the scripts directory.
 In the driver sub directory you will find the scripts to
 start the builtin keyboard effects.


 - Changing effect example

 :: the following command will create a render node for the effect with the unique id: 8 [fx_uid,name,description] ::

	razer_bcd_controller -C 8 "bars example" "new rendering node"

[Returns the render node uid of the created node]


:: to activate the render node with the unique id:2 execute the next command [rn_uid] (hint: the id was returned by the previous command) ::

	razer_bcd_controller -b 2

[You should now see 3 moving color bars (Red,Blue,Green)]


 - Customizing effects (setting of parameters) example

:: Getting the available parameters of an effect with the unique id: 2 [rn_uid] ::

 	razer_bcd_controller -F 2

 [Returns a json formatted list of the available effect parameters]

 in this case:

	{
 	"parameters_num" : 3 ,
 	"parameters_list": [
	{
 	"key": "Effect Counter Array",
 	"id" : 1 ,
 	"type" : 11 ,
 	"description": "Counter values(int array)" },
	{
 	"key": "Effect Direction Array",
 	"id" : 2 ,
 	"type" : 11 ,
 	"description": "Direction values(int array)" },
	{
 	"key": "Effect Colors Array",
 	"id" : 3 ,
 	"type" : 14 ,
 	"description": "Base colors(rgb array)" },
	]}

:: Setting a parameter for an effect with the unique id: 2 
   [rn_uid,parameter_index,
    array_index (use -1 if not an array),
    parameter_type,value(s) (enquote multiple values and use whitespaces to seperate)] ::	

	razer_bcd_controller -S 2 2 0 rgb "255 255 0"

[One bar should now have a yellow color]

:: Return to default effect :: 

	razer_bcd_controller -b 1

[You should now see the heatmap like default effect again]

 
 
 And take a look at the daemon and tests sub directories in scripts.
 The daemon uses dbus as its IPC mechanism, so you are not bound to shell scripts
 (someone may even write a Gui to control the daemon , maybe like the node editor in blender)


### Bash functions

In the file `/usr/share/razer_bcd/bash_keyboard_functions.sh` there are some functions used before and after the daemon is started/stopped. These functions bind and unbind the chroma to the kernel
driver. You can source the file and then run `bind_all`, this will attempt to bind chromas and skip any already binded. There is also a function called `unbind_all` which as you would
of guessed unbinds all chroma keyboards.






## Daemon IPC details

[... To be written ...]
 
 for a sneak peak take a look at:
 
 (bash interface using daemon_controller)
  - scripts/daemon/alert.sh
  - scripts/tests/test_daemon.sh
  - scripts/tests/test_glimmer.sh
 
 or simply call daemon_controller/razer_bcd_controller -h 
 for a command overview.

 (c api)
  - lib/razer_chroma_controller.h 
  - examples/controller_example.c

## First Steps Tutorial


How to create a standalone effect easily using the included library ?

First of all we need an idea what the effect shall do.

In this example i just setup the keyboard for a dota profile

First we need to setup the library:

        struct razer_chroma *chroma = razer_open();


To create an custom keyboard led layout we need to tell the library to activate the custom mode:

        razer_set_custom_mode(chroma);

If the keyboard was using the custom mode before the keys are still lit with the last color settings ,so let us clear it:

        razer_clear_all(chroma->keys);

To actually update the keyboard leds we need to razer_update (using the integrated keyboard led frame/keys struct):

        razer_update_keys(chroma,chroma->keys);

So now that we got a black keyboard we want to light some keys in different colors

        struct razer_rgb red = {.r=255,.g=0,.b=0}; //define a red color
        struct razer_rgb yellow = {.r=255,.g=255,.b=0}; //define a yellow color
        struct razer_rgb green = {.r=0,.g=255,.b=0}; //define a green color
        struct razer_rgb blue = {.r=0,.g=0,.b=255}; //define a blue color
        struct razer_rgb light_blue = {.r=0,.g=255,.b=255}; //define a light blue color
	
        struct razer_pos pos;

        char *abilities = "QWERDF";

        for(int i = 0;i<strlen(abilities);i++)
        {	
		razer_convert_ascii_to_pos(abilities[i],&pos);
		razer_set_key_pos(chroma->keys,&pos,&red);
        }

        char *groups = "1234567";

        for(int i = 0;i<strlen(groups);i++)
        {	
		razer_convert_ascii_to_pos(groups[i],&pos);
		razer_set_key_pos(chroma->keys,&pos,&yellow);
        }

        char *items = "YXCV";

        for(int i = 0;i<strlen(items);i++)
        {	
		razer_convert_ascii_to_pos(items[i],&pos);
		razer_set_key_pos(chroma->keys,&pos,&light_blue);
        }


        razer_convert_ascii_to_pos('B',&pos);
        razer_set_key_pos(chroma->keys,&pos,&green);

        razer_convert_ascii_to_pos('A',&pos);
        razer_set_key_pos(chroma->keys,&pos,&blue);

        razer_convert_ascii_to_pos('S',&pos);
        razer_set_key_pos(chroma->keys,&pos,&green);


Dont forget to update the keyboard with the new led color values:

        razer_update_keys(chroma,chroma->keys);


Freeing the library is just as easy:

        razer_close(chroma);


To compile just type:

        gcc  -std=c99  dota_keys.c  -lrazer_chroma  -lm  -o dota_keys

After executing it you should now have a dota profile lighting up your keyboard.(dont forget to sudo)
This is just a simple example using a ascii helper,if your profile needs to color function keys ,etc
you can set the key colors by manually setting the pos.






##Daemon effects tutorial


How to create an effect to be used in the daemon ?
Why not shoot for something crazy like a light blast originating from keys being pressed this time?
Its not that much different than writing a self-hosted effect.

##Contributions


Any effect or tool you might want to contribute is welcome.
Please use your own source files to host your effects for merging.
FX setup scripts, bug fixes, feature requests, etc are also welcome.


## TODO


- support remaining effect handlers not called yet once
- key locking / automatically skip key on following frame changes 
  / manual overwrite still possible / catch in convience functions
- daemon,internal heatmap examples
- integrate `examples/dynamic` with daemon for passwordless GUI interface ?
- daemon to remember current effect and colours in use ?
- move remaining lib functions to razer_ namespace
- move all daemon types to daemon_ namespace
- split library into seperate source files (rgb,frames,hsl,drawing)
- free memory / fix leaks
- submit kernel patch ?
- customizable layout effect
- fft analyzer effect
- better multi device support
- configuration for daemon (mouse input device,chroma devices to be used,etc)
- add custom event sending via controller api
- add list loaded libs command (automatic dupe check too)
- add a minimal (custom mode only) daemon integrated libusb driver (windows/mac osx support)
