openrazer-daemon - Daemon to manage Razer devices in userspace
.P
.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
\fBopenrazer-daemon\fR [options.\&.\&.\&]
.P
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\fBopenrazer-daemon\fR is a userspace service which is designed to be an intermediary between userspace programs and the Razer drivers.\& It will provide some higher level functions to allow similar operation to the Windows Razer Synapse program.\& This service is designed to be started by xdg-autostart as a session service.\&
.P
The service has the functionality to sync effects between multiple devices, perform on-the-fly macro recording and playback and reimplements the FN+Keys logic so they work when \fBmacro_keys\fR are enabled.\& The service can also perform various ripple effects and turn off the devices when the screensaver is active.\&
.P
Note, that all paths shown as defaults, eg ~/.\&local/share/ or ~/.\&config/ can be changed with XDG Base Directory specification variables: \fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\fR, \fB$XDG_DATA_HOME\fR and \fB$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR\fR.\&
.P
.SH OPTIONS
.P
\fB-v\fR, \fB--verbose\fR
.RS 4
Enable logging of DEBUG messages.\&
.P
.RE
\fB-F\fR, \fB--foreground\fR
.RS 4
Run the daemon in the foreground and don't fork.\& This also enables sending the log output to stdout (in addition to the log file).\&
.P
.RE
\fB-r\fR, \fB--respawn\fR
.RS 4
Stop any running daemon first (if one is running) before starting.\&
.P
.RE
\fB-s\fR, \fB--stop\fR
.RS 4
Gracefully stop the running daemon.\&
.P
.RE
\fB--as-root\fR
.RS 4
Allow the daemon to be started as root.\&
.P
.RE
\fB--config\fR=\fIconfig_file\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the location of the config file.\& If this is not provided it will default to ~/.\&config/openrazer/razer.\&conf and create it if needed from the example config.\&
.P
.RE
\fB--persistence\fR=\fIpersistence_file\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the location of the persistence file.\& This will be created if non-existent.\& This file will store device states so they persist between reboots.\&
.P
.RE
\fB--run-dir\fR=\fIrun_directory\fR
.RS 4
Tells the daemon what directory is its run directory, the directory it will change to once started.\& It will default to \fB$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR\fR, if not set it falls back to ~/.\&local/share/openrazer/.\&
.P
.RE
\fB--log-dir\fR=\fIlog_directory\fR
.RS 4
This argument decides where the log directory will be, the daemon itself will handle log rotation as it's a user session service.\& The daemon will default to ~/.\&local/share/openrazer/logs/ for its log directory.\&
.P
.RE
\fB--test-dir\fR=\fItest_dir\fR
.RS 4
If provided the daemon will operate in test-driver mode in which it exposes devices that aren't physically connected.\& Use \fIscripts/create_fake_device.\&py\fR or \fIscripts/setup_fake_devices.\&sh\fR from the source repository to create the directory structure.\&
