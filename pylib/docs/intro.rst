Intro
=====

The Python library (also referred to as pylib) was designed to interface with razer-daemon and its many DBus methods. The aim being that it would be far simpler using a few python objects than dealing with the 
complexities of DBus and figuring out what methods to call and with what parameters etc...

The pylib was designed to be used by developers and tinkerers alike. I hope to have some useful examples/docs on the next few pages. 
The effects in the `promo <https://youtu.be/3JrqJA8d5BE?t=1m55s>`_ video was done using the pylib.
