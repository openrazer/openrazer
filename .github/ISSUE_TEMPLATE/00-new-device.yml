        ## Before you continue...

          [üîç Search for existing issues and pull requests](https://github.com/openrazer/openrazer/issues?q=label%3A%22Device+Support%22) by searching for your USB PID. Please avoid creating duplicates.

          You can get your USB PID by running `lsusb` in a terminal:

          ```shell
          lsusb | grep 1532
          ```

          For example, if you see `1532:0203`, your device PID is `0203`.

          Your device may have different PIDs depending if it's wired or wireless, so check those too.

          If the issue is closed, or the pull request is merged (purple), your device is supported in the next release. [Check the comparison](https://github.com/openrazer/openrazer/compare/stable...master) to see if that's the case!
